# Datacamp-Intermediate_SQL
 SQL is the most popular language for turnng raw data stored in a database into actionabale insights. I have completed Intermediate SQL course in DataCamp.

 Using a database of films made around the world, I have covered:
 
 - How to filter and compare data
 - How to use aggregate functions to summarize data
 - How to sort and group data
 - How to present the data cleanly using tools such as rounding and aliasing
